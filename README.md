# Microservice Architecture Project

## Overview
This project represents a simple model of a microservice architecture built on API endpoints. The API documentation for each endpoint is located in the `apiDoc` folder.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Project**
   Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Database Initialization**
   - Navigate to the `sql` folder.
   - Execute the scripts provided to create the necessary databases and tables.
   - Use a database management tool or the command line to run the scripts.
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p < script_name.sql
     ```

3. **Create an Admin**
   - Use the endpoint `adminGateway.php` with the following request body:
     ```json
     {
         "action": "create"
     }
     ```
   - This will generate the admin account with an email and password. Save these credentials.

4. **Generate an Admin API Key**
   - Call the endpoint `createAdminToken.php`.
   - In the request body, provide the email and password generated by `adminGateway.php`:
     ```json
     {
         "email": "admin_email",
         "password": "admin_password"
     }
     ```
   - The response will include an API key. Save this key securely.

5. **Database Configuration**
   - Each endpoint has its own configuration file for database connection settings.
   - Update these files with the appropriate database credentials.

## Notes
- The API documentation is available in the `apiDoc` folder.
- Ensure that the database credentials and admin API key are kept secure.
- Follow the sequence of steps above for smooth initialization and usage.
- At first - run all scripts in SQL folder, and nex - run all SQL scripts im update folder - This is extremely important for the correct functioning of API V1
